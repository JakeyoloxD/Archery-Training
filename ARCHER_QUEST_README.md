# Archer Learning Materials

## 📚 What's Included?

This repository contains TWO learning approaches for mastering Archer and passing the Associate Exam:

### 1. **BUILD Workbook** (RECOMMENDED) - `archer_build_workbook.json`
A hands-on workbook where you **BUILD an Archer application from scratch**. Just like learning Archer by creating a D&D character sheet, you learn by DOING, not just reading.

### 2. **Guided Quest** (Original) - `archer_newbie_quest.json` + `index.html`
An interactive guided tour through Archer features with practice exercises.
